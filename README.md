# getalife 

React App for finding inspiring things to do. Made with React, fetches data from WordPress site's JSON api. Work in progress - still missing some features, for example better search functionality and ability to search things to do by duration.

This app is made for someone struggling to enjoy the life every day. Someone being too tired to figure out what they really want to do and doing the same boring stuff every day. Watching TV, playing the same old games, spending time looking at other people's lives in social media, instead of living their own life. An app to help you get a life.
