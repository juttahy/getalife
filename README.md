# getalife

A one woman's project for someone struggling to enjoy the life every day. Someone being too tired to figure out what they really want to do and doing the same boring stuff every day. Watching TV, playing the same old games, spending time looking at other people's lives in social media, instead of living their own life. Get a life.
